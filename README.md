# 🎓 Student Engagement Detection System

**AI-Based Student Engagement Detection in Online Classes Using Optimized MobileNetV2**

## 📌 Project Overview

Student engagement is a critical factor influencing learning outcomes in online education, yet it is difficult to monitor in virtual environments. This project presents an **AI-based student engagement detection system** that analyzes facial expressions to classify student engagement levels in real time.

The system leverages **transfer learning with MobileNetV2**, applies multiple optimization techniques, and compares performance against a **custom CNN model**. Experimental results demonstrate that the **optimized MobileNetV2 model** achieves the highest accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time educational platforms.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automatically detect student engagement during online classes  
- Compare baseline and optimized deep learning models  
- Evaluate performance using standard classification metrics  
- Address ethical and practical challenges in AI-based education systems  

## 🧠 Engagement Categories

The system classifies students into the following six engagement-related categories:

- Engaged  
- Confused  
- Frustrated  
- Bored  
- Drowsy  
- Looking Away
